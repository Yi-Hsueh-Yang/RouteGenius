They leverage a set of external tools and a large language model (LLM) to address users' questions related to supply chain applications. For a comprehensive understanding of the design and data flow, detailed information can be found in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03875).\n","\n","\n","![optiguide system](https://www.beibinli.com/docs/optiguide/optiguide_system.png)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8b7f90c8","metadata":{"id":"8b7f90c8"},"source":["## New Implementation\n","\n","\n","\n","![](new_design.png)\n","\n","Advantages of this multi-agent design with autogen:\n","- Collaborative Problem Solving: The collaboration among the user proxy agent and the assistant agents fosters a cooperative problem-solving environment. The agents can share information and knowledge, allowing them to complement each other's abilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. On the other hand, the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker, which can perform another safety check pass on the generated code.\n","\n","- Modularity: The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each agent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall development process and facilitating code management.\n","\n","- Memory Management: The OptiGuide agent's role in maintaining memory related to user interactions is crucial. The memory retention allows the agents to have context about a user's prior questions, making the decision-making process more informed and context-aware.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"26bbd037","metadata":{"id":"26bbd037"},"outputs":[],"source":["# pip install
